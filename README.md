## Foreword 

"I'm literally the smartest programmer that is ever lived"

## We turn your poetry, songs, writings, the product of your tortured soul, into a unique NFT that will forever attest of the unicity of your work as a Writer.

### Because why should your words be less precious than a tweet or a pictures of pictures ? 
### After all, it takes endless nights of sufferings, despairs, and self-destruction to be a true writer. Let's make writting fair again. 
### And may we give back the power to the ones that translate Zeitgeists into understanable words.
